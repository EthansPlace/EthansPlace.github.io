<p style="font-size:20px;color:white;">Born in 2000, Ethan H. Place was the first person ever. At the tender age of 8 he managed to broker peace in the middle east and then 2 years later took it back because "they made me mad". Found guilty of numerous crimes,
 both domestic and war related, 
he is currently on the run from several agencies. He has undergone extensive cosmetic surgeries to elude the authorities among those being a height reduction procedure to go from 6 ft. 9 in. to 5 ft. 28in. In his spare time he likes 
short walks on the beach and 
doing whatever the complete opposite of sex is. By 2026 he will be fully assimilated into the CCP as the new president of the People's Republic of China. With these new powers he plans on iniating an invasion of Vietnam in operation
